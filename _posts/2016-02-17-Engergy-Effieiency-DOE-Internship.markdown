[Opportunities in Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy][official link]
Project Description:

The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) Research Participation Program provides 
opportunities for students, postgraduates, established scientists and faculty to participate in programs, projects, and 
activities that support the mission of the EERE. Participants may hold appointments at DOE-EERE Headquarters, EERE field 
offices, and other EERE-approved sites.  Participants will receive hands-on experience that provides them with an 
understanding of the mission, operations, and culture of EERE.  As a result, participants will gain deep insight into the 
federal government's role in the creation and implementation of energy technology policies; apply their scientific and 
technical expertise to the development of solutions to issues of importance to the EERE; and continue their education and
involvement in areas that support the EERE mission either in a technical or policy related role.

EERE Mission: The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) is at the center of creating the clean energy economy
today. EERE leads the U.S. Department of Energy's efforts to develop and deliver market-driven solutions for energy-saving 
homes, buildings, and manufacturing; sustainable transportation; and renewable electricity generation.
