[Official Posting for PSU Students][posting]


My employer, [Engility][Engility], currently has three job openings for Geospatial Intelligence Analysts. 
They are at different levels -- 2, 3 & 4. They are all located in Springfield Virginia. 
The most direct way to read and apply to the jobs are from the [Engility Careers web site][Engility Careers].
Simply type in the requisition number and the link to the application will be next. TS/SCI clearance and polygraph required.

The requisitions are as follows: 18907, 18908, 19117. 
They all begin with 2016-, but that isn't necessary in order to conduct the search. 
Suffice to say, qualifications of the applicant dictate which position is appropriate. 
I recommend anyone with knowledge, experience and desire in GEOINT may apply. 
I also highly recommend they send a copy of their resume to me at steven.douglas@tasc.com 
It's a great opportunity...
