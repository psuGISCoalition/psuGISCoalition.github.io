The GIS Coalition will be meeting Thursday April 7th in 123 Walker from 6-8pm. As many of our officers will be graduating, this week we will hold officer elections. 

We'll also discuss becoming an affiliate chapter of YouthMappers http://www.youthmappers.org/ !
YouthMapper is a new organization that uses open GIS technology to create resilient communities and define their world by mapping it. Members of a chapter are eligible for leadership, recognition and fellowship opportunities. Chapters are currently collaboraing with U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) on the following projects: Food Insecurity in Bangladesh, Health & Disease Prevention in Mozambique and Natural Disaster Preparation in Ecuador.
