Geospatial/Geoscience Data Specialist - U.S. Department of Energy

National Energy Technology Laboratory- Morgantown, WV

Project Description:

Through the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) this posting seeks motivated, students interested in
working as part of geologic and environmental sciences focus area research team at NETL.  NETL is a multi-disciplinary, 
scientific and technical-oriented national laboratory. NETL’s Office of Research and Development conducts research to 
evaluate environmental impacts and risk assessments associated with domestic energy resource development. 

Current research utilizing geospatial, geostatistical, and geologic expertise includes; i) geologic CO2 storage, ii) 
environmental impacts of shale gas production, iii) risk assessment for CO2 storage, and iv) geospatial-based risk 
assessments of ultra-deepwater drilling activities in the Gulf of Mexico and Arctic. 

At present, the team is looking for support from applicants with a background in one or more of the following areas: GIS, 
reservoir geology, petrophysics, geologic characterization of subsurface systems, gas shale systems, marine resources (oil,
natural gas, hydrates), groundwater systems, geostatistics, geophysics, and geology.  Applicants with expertise working with 
subsurface & GIS software systems, such as ESRI’s ArcGIS, Python scripting, Petra etc. and geoscience knowledge of petroleum 
systems is preferred.

Position requirements:
* Applicants must be U.S. Citizens or approved Foreign Nationals
* Suitable for Federal employment, as determined by background investigation
* Must be in a degree program or hold an existing bachelor’s degree

Additional Information:

As an ORISE student researcher you may work with geospatial and modeling teams to identify, format and integrate key 
datasets. These datasets are the foundation to conducting advanced research that integrates and quantitatively evaluates key
attributes of gas shale, ultra-deep water and frontier regions to estimate potential risks related to oil/natural gas 
development, and/or CO2 storage. 

Depending on skills and your background you may be asked to assist with:
* Design, development, and integration of an extensive body of existing GIS information, data and metadata.
* Produce of both spatial and non-spatial datasets, potentially including, computer-generated maps, graphs, tables and reports.
* Contribute to geospatial resource studies by collecting and analyzing hydrologic, geologic, engineering, and energy resource data, and reviewing and investigating data quality and integrity.
* Apply database management, statistical analysis, python scripting and various other computer related skills to assist in the scientific evaluation of resources (water, oil, gas, CO2) relationships and problems.
* Write portions of interpretive reports and data reports, and assist with preparation of data for publication.

How to Apply:

Applicants should apply through the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) program. The ORISE Program provides opportunities for undergraduate students, recent graduates, graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty researchers. NETL utilizes the ORISE program to support research and work within NETL’s Office of Research & Development.
