[Summer of Maps][Summer of Maps] is a fellowship program organized by Azavea. Summer of Maps offers stipends to student GIS analysts to perform geospatial data analysis for non-profit organizations. Every year we match up non-profit organizations that have spatial analysis needs with talented students of GIS to implement projects over a three-month period during the summer.

In the past students have worked on projects in: arts & culture, community & economic development, electons & civil rights, environment, sustainability & ecosystems, public health & food, pubic safety and transportation.
